A browser extension that brings useful features Microsoft should've included in the first place. Built openly, without marketing fluff or red tape — just practical tools for real admins.

⚠️ Security Advisory

This extension retrieves your Graph API token from browser storage and uses it as an Authorization header in Microsoft Graph requests.

Read the code. Trust your gut. It's public software from a developer on the internet — be cautious and audit before use.
